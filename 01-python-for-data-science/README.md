# Phase 1: Python for Data Science

Master the essential Python libraries for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.

##  What You'll Learn

- NumPy for numerical computing
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization

##  Modules

### 01-numpy
Learn NumPy - the foundation of numerical computing in Python.

**Topics:**
- Creating Arrays
- Array Operations
- Indexing and Slicing
- Broadcasting
- Mathematical Operations
- Linear Algebra Operations

**Time Estimate:** 1 week

### 02-pandas
Master Pandas - the most important library for data manipulation.

**Topics:**
- Series and DataFrames
- Reading and Writing Data (CSV, Excel, JSON)
- Data Selection and Filtering
- Data Cleaning (Missing Values, Duplicates)
- Grouping and Aggregation
- Merging and Joining DataFrames
- Time Series Operations

**Time Estimate:** 2 weeks

### 03-visualization
Create beautiful and informative visualizations.

**Topics:**
- Matplotlib Basics (Line, Bar, Scatter, Histogram plots)
- Seaborn Statistical Visualizations
- Customizing Plots
- Subplots and Multiple Plots
- Saving Figures

**Time Estimate:** 1 week

##  Learning Objectives

By the end of this phase, you should be able to:
- Perform numerical operations with NumPy
- Load, clean, and manipulate datasets with Pandas
- Create various types of visualizations
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)

##  Projects

1. **Data Analysis Project**: Analyze a real dataset (e.g., sales data, weather data)
2. **Visualization Project**: Create a dashboard with multiple visualizations

##  Tips

- Practice with real datasets from Kaggle or UCI Repository
- Focus on understanding data structures (Series, DataFrame)
- Learn to read documentation - it's a crucial skill
- Experiment with different plot types
