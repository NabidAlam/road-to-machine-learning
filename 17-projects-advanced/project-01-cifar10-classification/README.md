# Project 1: Image Classification (CIFAR-10)

Build a CNN to classify images into 10 categories with high accuracy.

## Difficulty
Advanced

## Time Estimate
1-2 weeks

## Skills You'll Practice
- CNNs
- Transfer Learning
- Data Augmentation
- Model Optimization

## Learning Objectives

- Build advanced CNN architectures
- Apply transfer learning with pre-trained models
- Use data augmentation effectively
- Optimize models for performance
- Handle complex image data

## Dataset

**CIFAR-10**
- Built into Keras: `keras.datasets.cifar10`
- 50,000 training images, 10,000 test images
- 32x32 color images in 10 classes

## Project Steps

1. Load and explore CIFAR-10 dataset
2. Build baseline CNN
3. Apply data augmentation
4. Use transfer learning (ResNet, VGG, etc.)
5. Optimize hyperparameters
6. Achieve >90% accuracy
7. Compare different architectures

## Expected Deliverables

- Complete notebook with analysis
- Trained model achieving >90% accuracy
- Comparison of different architectures
- Deployment-ready model
