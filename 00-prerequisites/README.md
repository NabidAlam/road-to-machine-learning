# Phase 0: Prerequisites

Welcome to the foundation phase! Before diving into machine learning, we need to build a solid foundation in programming and mathematics.

##  What You'll Learn

- Python programming fundamentals
- Essential mathematics for ML (Linear Algebra, Statistics, Calculus)
- Setting up your development environment

##  Modules

### 01-python-basics
Learn Python from scratch - variables, data types, control flow, functions, and object-oriented programming basics.

**Topics:**
- Variables and Data Types
- Control Flow (if/else, loops)
- Functions
- Lists, Dictionaries, Tuples
- File I/O
- Error Handling
- Object-Oriented Programming Basics

**Time Estimate:** 2-3 weeks

### 02-mathematics-basics
Essential mathematical concepts needed for understanding ML algorithms.

**Topics:**
- **Linear Algebra**: Vectors, Matrices, Matrix Operations, Eigenvalues
- **Statistics**: Mean, Median, Mode, Variance, Standard Deviation, Probability Distributions
- **Calculus**: Derivatives, Gradients, Optimization Basics

**Time Estimate:** 2-3 weeks

### 03-environment-setup
Set up your development environment for ML work.

**Topics:**
- Installing Python
- Virtual Environments
- Installing Jupyter Notebook
- Installing Essential Libraries
- IDE Setup (VS Code/PyCharm)

**Time Estimate:** 1 day

##  Learning Objectives

By the end of this phase, you should be able to:
- Write basic Python programs
- Understand mathematical notation used in ML
- Set up and use Jupyter Notebooks
- Install and manage Python packages

##  Exercises

Each module includes:
- Concept explanations
- Code examples
- Practice exercises
- Solutions

##  Getting Started

1. Start with `01-python-basics`
2. Complete all exercises
3. Move to `02-mathematics-basics`
4. Set up your environment in `03-environment-setup`

##  Tips

- **Don't skip this phase!** A strong foundation makes everything easier
- Practice coding daily, even if just 30 minutes
- Use Python's interactive mode to experiment
- Don't worry about mastering everything - you'll learn more as you go
