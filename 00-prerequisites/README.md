## Important Notes

### Mathematics Learning Strategy

1. **Don't Skip Math**: Strong mathematical foundation makes ML much easier
2. **Focus on Intuition**: Understand concepts, not just formulas
3. **Practice with Code**: Use NumPy to implement concepts
4. **Visual Learning**: Watch 3Blue1Brown videos for geometric intuition
5. **Apply to ML**: Connect each concept to ML applications

### Recommended Learning Order

1. **Linear Algebra First**: Foundation for everything
2. **Statistics Second**: Needed for data understanding
3. **Calculus Third**: Needed for optimization
4. **Practice Together**: Work on exercises combining all three

### Time Investment

- **Total Time**: 6-8 weeks for thorough understanding
- **Minimum**: 4 weeks for basic understanding
- **Practice**: Code along with examples, don't just read!
