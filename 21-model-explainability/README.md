- Model-agnostic methods

### 3. SHAP
- Tree SHAP
- Kernel SHAP
- SHAP visualizations

### 4. LIME
- Local explanations
- Tabular data
- Text and image data

### 5. Partial Dependence Plots
- Understanding feature effects
- Interaction effects

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you should be able to:
