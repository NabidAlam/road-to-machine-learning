# Phase 2: Introduction to Machine Learning

Understand what machine learning is, how it works, and the different types of ML problems.

##  What You'll Learn

- What is Machine Learning?
- Types of Machine Learning
- ML Workflow and Best Practices
- Real-world Applications

##  Topics Covered

### What is Machine Learning?
- Definition and Core Concepts
- Difference from Traditional Programming
- Why Machine Learning Matters
- History and Evolution

### Types of Machine Learning

#### 1. Supervised Learning
- Learning from labeled data
- Regression vs Classification
- Examples: Predicting house prices, spam detection

#### 2. Unsupervised Learning
- Learning from unlabeled data
- Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction
- Examples: Customer segmentation, anomaly detection

#### 3. Reinforcement Learning
- Learning through interaction
- Reward-based learning
- Examples: Game playing, robotics

### Machine Learning Workflow

1. **Problem Definition**: Understand the business problem
2. **Data Collection**: Gather relevant data
3. **Data Preparation**: Clean and preprocess data
4. **Feature Engineering**: Create meaningful features
5. **Model Selection**: Choose appropriate algorithms
6. **Training**: Train the model on data
7. **Evaluation**: Assess model performance
8. **Deployment**: Put model into production
9. **Monitoring**: Track model performance over time

### Best Practices

- Start with simple models
- Use appropriate evaluation metrics
- Avoid data leakage
- Split data properly (train/validation/test)
- Document everything
- Version control your code and data

- Distinguish between different types of ML (Supervised, Unsupervised, Reinforcement)
- Understand the complete ML workflow from problem to deployment
- Identify which type of ML to use for a given problem
- Select appropriate algorithms for different scenarios
- Build your first ML model from scratch
- Understand common ML terminology
- Avoid common pitfalls and follow best practices

##  Exercises

1. **Identify ML Problem Types**: Classify real-world scenarios (regression/classification/clustering)
2. **Design ML Workflow**: Create workflow for a given business problem
3. **Build First Model**: Complete the [First ML Project Tutorial](first-ml-project-tutorial.md)
4. **Algorithm Selection**: Use the [Algorithm Selection Guide](problem-identification-algorithm-selection.md) to choose algorithms for different problems
5. **Terminology Quiz**: Test your understanding using the [ML Terminology Reference](ml-terminology.md)

##  Key Concepts

- **Training Data**: Data used to teach the model
- **Testing Data**: Data used to evaluate the model
- **Features**: Input variables
- **Labels/Targets**: Output variables (for supervised learning)
- **Model**: The learned function that makes predictions
- **Overfitting**: Model memorizes training data, performs poorly on new data
- **Underfitting**: Model is too simple, can't capture patterns
