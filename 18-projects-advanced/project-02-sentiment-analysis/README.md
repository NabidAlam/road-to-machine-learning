# Project 2: Sentiment Analysis on Reviews

Build a sentiment analysis system for product/movie reviews using advanced NLP.

## Difficulty
Advanced

## Time Estimate
1-2 weeks

## Skills You'll Practice
- NLP
- RNNs/LSTMs
- Transformers
- Text Classification

## Learning Objectives

- Apply advanced text preprocessing
- Use word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe)
- Build RNN/LSTM architectures
- Implement Transformer models (BERT)
- Handle variable text lengths

## Dataset

**IMDB Reviews or Amazon Reviews**
- [IMDB Reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews)
- Large text dataset
- Binary or multi-class sentiment

## Project Steps

1. Load and preprocess text data
2. Create word embeddings
3. Build LSTM model
4. Implement BERT/Transformer
5. Compare approaches
6. Deploy as API

## Expected Deliverables

- Sentiment analysis model
- Comparison of LSTM vs BERT
- API for real-time predictions
- Performance analysis
