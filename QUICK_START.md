```

## Step 2: Set Up Environment

### Option A: Using Anaconda (Recommended)

```bash
# Install Anaconda from https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual

# Create environment
conda create -n ml-env python=3.10
conda activate ml-env

# Install packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Option B: Using Python venv

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv ml-env

# Activate (Windows)
ml-env\Scripts\activate

# Activate (Mac/Linux)
source ml-env/bin/activate

# Install packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Step 3: Install Jupyter

```bash
pip install jupyter notebook
```

## Step 4: Start Learning!
