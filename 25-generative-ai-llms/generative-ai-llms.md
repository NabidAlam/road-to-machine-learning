## Introduction

### Why This Module?

The AI industry has rapidly shifted from training models from scratch to using pre-trained foundational models (LLMs). This module teaches you how to:

- **Use LLMs effectively** through prompt engineering
- **Build RAG systems** for knowledge-augmented AI
- **Create AI agents** that can reason and use tools
- **Deploy production GenAI apps** that solve real problems

### What You'll Build

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:
- Build RAG systems for document Q&A
- Create autonomous AI agents
- Deploy GenAI applications to production
- Optimize LLM applications for cost and performance
